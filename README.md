# ü©∫ EHR System - Full Stack Application

This project implements a comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR) system featuring a FastAPI backend and an Angular frontend. It is designed for managing structured patient data, laboratory tests, and measurements with full version control, enabling both current state access and a complete audit history.

## Backend System

### üìú Overview

The backend is an **Electronic Health Record (EHR) system** built using **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **SQLite**. It focuses on managing versioned patient data, lab results, and clinical compositions.

### üìê Architecture

*   **FastAPI**: Serves as the RESTful API server.
*   **SQLAlchemy**: Used as the ORM for database modeling and access.
*   **SQLite**: The default database backend, easily swappable.
*   **Pydantic**: Employed for schemas, data validation, and serialization.
*   **Docker-friendly**: Designed to be lightweight for local or containerized deployment.

### Database Schema

The database consists of main tables for current data and history tables for audit trails.
Database is implemented in SQlite.

#### Main Tables

*   **`Patient`**: Stores patient demographic data and identifiers.
    *   `id` (Integer, Primary Key): Unique identifier for the patient.

    *   `high` (Float, Optional): Upper bound of the normal range.
    *   `unit` (String, Optional): Unit for the reference range values.
    *   `version` (Integer): Version of this reference range definition.

#### History Tables (Audit Trail)

Each of the main entities (`Patient`, `Composition`, `Specimen`, `LabTest`, `LabAnalyteResult`, `BodyMeasurement`, `ReferenceRange`) has a corresponding `_history` table (e.g., `patient_history`, `composition_history`, `reference_range_history`). These tables store all previous versions of the records and include:
*   A foreign key to the original entity in the main table.
*   A full snapshot of the data as it was at that version.
*   A `version` number.
*   An `updated_at` timestamp indicating when that version was archived.

This structure enables full traceability and reconstruction of historical states.

### üì° API Overview

The backend provides RESTful endpoints for managing EHR data.

#### Core CRUD Operations

All main entities (`Patient`, `Composition`, `Specimen`, `LabTest`, `LabAnalyteResult`, `BodyMeasurement`, `ReferenceRange`) generally support the following operations:

*   **`POST /<entity_name>/create`**: Creates a new entity record (e.g., `POST /patient/`).
*   **`GET /<entity_name>/{id}`**: Retrieves a specific entity record by its ID (e.g., `GET /patient/1`).
*   **`GET /<entity_name>/all`**: Retrieves a list of entity records, often with pagination (e.g., `GET /patient/`).
*   **`PUT /<entity_name>/update/{id}`**: Updates an existing entity record. This archives the current version to the history table and increments the version number of the main record (e.g., `PUT /patient/1`).
*   **`DELETE /<entity_name>/delete/{id}`**: Deletes an entity record from the main table and clears its associated history (e.g., `DELETE /patient/1`).

#### Special Routes

*   **`GET /patient/{id}/full`**: A comprehensive endpoint that fetches:
    *   Patient demographics.
    *   All compositions for a patient.
    *   All lab tests associated with those compositions, including their analytes and specimen details.
    *   All body measurements for a patient.

# üê≥ Running the Full Application with Docker

This project is configured to run both the backend and frontend services using Docker Compose for a streamlined setup.

### Prerequisites

*   Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine and Docker Compose CLI) installed and running.

### Steps to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository (if you haven\'t already):**
    ```bash
    # git clone <repository-url>
    cd open_ehr_app
    ```

2.  **Build and Start the Services:**
    Open a terminal in the root directory of the project (i.e., where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located) and run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    *   `--build`: This flag tells Docker Compose to build the images before starting the containers. You can omit `--build` on subsequent runs if the Dockerfiles or application code haven\'t changed significantly, and just use `docker-compose up`.
    *   The services will start in the foreground, and you\'ll see logs from both the backend and frontend.

3.  **Accessing the Application:**
    *   **Frontend**: Once the containers are up and running, the Angular frontend will be accessible at [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) (as per `docker-compose.yml` port mapping `80:80` for the frontend service).
    *   **Backend API**: The FastAPI backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. The frontend is configured to communicate with the backend at `http://backend:8000` internally within the Docker network. The API documentation (Swagger UI) can be accessed at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

4.  **Stopping the Application:**
    *   To stop the services, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `docker-compose up` is running.
    *   To stop and remove the containers, you can run:
        ```bash
        docker-compose down
        ```
